# Subitting Issues and Feature Requests
The issue tracker on the GitHub repository is the preferred way to report issues and submit feature requests. However, we will accept issues, feature requests and support tickets via our [Support Portal](https://support.boardiesitsolutions.com), however, any issues or feature requests that are raised via our portal, might be imported into the GitHub issue tracker. 

Please respeect the following restrictions
- Do not submit personal support requests to the GitHub issue tracker, instead raise a support ticket via our [Support Portal](https://support.boardiesitsolutions.com/support). 
- Do not troll or submit rude or abusive comments to reported issues, keep the conversation on topic and be respectful. 

# Bug Reports
A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by an issue with the code in the repository. We welcome bug reports we strive to make the best possible software and libraries possible, however, there is no such thing as completely bug free software, no matter how hard we try unforunately, thanks for taking the time to submit. 

Please follow the below guidelines before submitting a bug report.

1. Check that the issue you are experiencing doesn't already exist. If it does, and you have more information you can provide to help diagnose the issue, then please submit it as a comment, don't create a new issue. 
2. Check that the issue you have hasn't been marked as fixed, check you are using the latest tagged version or development branch before raising a new issue. 
3 . Demonstrate the problem you are having. Provide information such as logcat and if possible a code example showing you problem possibly screenshot of your issue as well if it is a display problem. 

A good bug report should not require Boardies IT Solutions or other contributors to have to chase you up to get more information. The more information that you can provide in your bug report will help get the bug fixes as quickly as possible. Some good things to include in your bug report are as follows: 
- Android version (either API level or Android version number e.g. API Level 15 or Android 4.0)
- If the library is causing an application crash, copy and paste your stacktrace
- If the issue is a display problem, provide a screenshot of the issue

# Feature Requests
We strongly encourage feature requests, we want to make the library as best as it can possibly be. Take a moment though to ensure that your feature request fits in to the scope and aim of the project. Its up to you to make a strong case to convince the project developers to implement the feature request. Please provide as much detail as possible. 

# Pull Requests
Pull requests for patches, improvements and feature requests are a great help and we really appreciate the time you put into the project to make this as best as it can possibly be. However the pull request should remain focused in the scope and aims of the project and avoid adding any unrelated commits. 

*Please ask before* submitting any pull requests (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language) otherwise you might risk spending a lot of time working on the project which might not get accepted into the project. 

*IMPORTANT:* By submitting a patch or new feature etc, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
